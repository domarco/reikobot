Touch the mouse takes advantage of her smallness in order to get into small holes and sneaking into things without the villains knowing. 

Gari-Gari is a mad scientist wolf who wants to build a mansion over the junkyard, constantly thinking up evil plans to get the money needed to buy the property, whether it’s creating a machine that creates counterfeit 10 yen  or stealing priceless paintings and selling it to a high bidder. He is an inventor, creating things that can aid him into doing his deed. If Gari-Gari buys the junkyard, this of course means that the three heroes will have no place to stay, so they constantly thwart his schemes. Gari-Gari has two henchmen working for him: Black and Nyu. Black is a gangster cat who welds a gun, often shooting at Punch and the gang with it. Nyu is a simple-minded pig who has big strength.

Tiger Mask was once a member of Tiger's Cave under the name &quot;Yellow Devil&quot;, but no longer wanted anything to do with them, instead donating his money to the orphanage.

The governing rule of the series was that the creative staff change from episode to episode. While later other anime series like Nippon Animation's Famous Works of Japanese Literature would attempt the same, none would be as long-lived or successful. 

The rotation idea was that of director Sugii Gisaburo, a visual visionary unequaled in Japanese film history who has revolutionized anime several times in his career, be it in the 1967 TV series Goku's Big Adventure, in which he sought to shake anime free from the dominance of story development by yanking it back to a more cartoonish form, or The Belladonna of Sadness, where he broke the Disney full-animation mold, creating a full-length animated film in a completely new style that was a hybrid of still drawings and animation. The reason for rotating the staff each episode was so that each episode would have a completely different look and feel from its predecessor, and in this it was eminently successful.

Old Jeppet the carpenter is terribly lonely, and yearns to have a son of his own. One day, a puppet he is carving out of wood begins to speak even before he has finished shaping it. The old man names the puppet Pinocchio, and treats him as the son he never had. The puppet is dreadfully naughty and causes trouble for the old man, but his heart is in the right place and he earns Jeppet’s love as though he were a human son. However, tragedy befalls the pair. Pinocchio is deceived by the wicked fox Dino and his sidekick, the cat Witch, while on his way to school. Pinocchio and his friend Gina the duck are sold to the master of a puppet show, with little hope of ever reuniting with kind old Jeppet. The naughty puppet eventually runs away in order to search for his surrogate father, and finds himself in the middle of adventure after adventure, matching wits with the crafty Dino and Witch. His efforts to stay out of mischief never seem to work, and misfortune always seeks out our wooden hero. If Pinocchio can only manage to stay out of trouble, his ultimate wish will be granted and his dream will become a reality. Delighting and entertaining, The Adventures of Pinocchio shows us that a pure heart and good intentions are rewarded, and that true love can indeed create miracles.

Dr. Yamanoue is very jingoistic and only thinks of the robot as one of his strategic arms. On the contrary, Dr. Kawashimo is a pacifist and devotes his affection to robots.

Dr. Kawashimo hurries to the island on request of Dr. Yamanoue, taking his pretty young daughter Miri with him. Arriving on the island, Dr. Kawashimo sets the electric brain into Jet Mars, a robot boy. Thus Mars comes into the world. Everything is new to Mars and he doesn&#039;t know what is good or bad. On the next day he lifts Dr. Kawashimo and Miri up onto the building. When he sees a glint of moisture in Miri&#039;s eyes, he has a mysterious feeling in his mind. Then he asks Dr. Yamanoue what it is. He is taught that it is a tear a weak girl sheds, but, a strong man never does.

One day, the electric brain of Fainton, another robot, is put out of order. So Fainton goes-on a wild rampage and the island is plunged into a crisis. When the seawater runs into the facilities from the big hole made by Fainton, only Mars stands in amazement and is quite at a loss what to do just then Miri exhibits her ultra ability and covers the big hole. Led by her, Mars also carries a sheet of iron and makes repairs. At last they rescue Dr. Yamanoue and Dr. Kawashimo from being washed by seawater. Miri is the robot made by Dr. Kawashimo. Mars learns how to cry and learns how to perform a kind deed";i:3;s:2:"TV";i:4;s:2:"27";i:5;s:15:"Finished Airing";i:6;s:11:"Feb 3, 1977";i:7;s:12:"Sep 15, 1977";i:8;s:11:"Winter 1977";i:9;s:14:"Toei Animation";i:10;s:8:"Original";i:11;s:25:"Action,Drama,Mecha,Sci-Fi";i:12;s:4:"4216";i:13;s:2:"82";i:14;s:45:"http://myanimelist.net/anime/6087/Jetter_Mars";}i:217;a:15:{i:0;s:4:"3294";i:1;s:29:"Gasshin Sentai Mechander Robo";i:2;s:1022:"The Doron Empire from the Ganymede System discovered Earth as an ideal world for them to conquer.

Due to the fact that pollution was becoming a major problem, scientists had developed the use of hydrogen fuel called "HBT" as an alternative to fossil fuels. At this time humans have colonized Mars in search of new place to call home as a result of overpopulation. In the year 2050, a mysterious alien race called the Inbit invaded the Earth. Unable to fight the Inbits, Earth became desolate with only a few pockets of human beings scattered throughout the planet. Many of the refugees escape aboard a few remaining shuttles to seek shelter on the Moon. The Inbit sets up their main base of operations in the Great Lakes area of North America called "Reflex Point".

 However, the Mars colony, dubbed the Mars Base, did not forget about the plight of Earth. Troops were sent in to fight the Inbits from the Moon, only to fail miserably. The Inbits did not attack Mars, and showed no interest towards the other planets. Surprisingly the Inbit show no hostility towards humans unless they are directly provoked. The Inbit can also sense the presence of HBT, and use of the fuel is limited under their supervision, as HBT is a common component in weapons technology. Overnight the Mars base becomes a gigantic military machine, producing vast amounts of advanced weaponry and trained troops. In 2080, Mars Base sent in the next wave of troops. Although equipped with more technologically advanced equipment and transformable mecha, the attempt to recapture the homeworld was nonetheless a failure.

Three years later, Mars Base launched another attack called the Second Earth Recapture Force. One of the troops happened to be Lieutenant Stick Bernard . The mission proved to be unsuccessful as it did three years ago and Stick's fiancée Marlene was killed. After losing her, Stick was forced to crash into Earth, landing in South America. At first, he was sorrowful and depressed at the death of his beloved Marlene. After seeing the holographic recording of his dead betrothed, Stick swore an oath of vengeance. In his quest to reach the Reflex Point on North America, the Inbit 'hive', he meets other characters of the show, forming a group of ragtag freedom fighters on a goal to rid the planet of the Inbits.

As the plot unravels, the purpose of the Inbits invasion is revealed. Their sole purpose of coming to the planet was because Earth provides them a suitable place to evolve into more complex beings. However, little did the Inbits know that their endeavor actually threatens to cause the extinction of both humans and Inbits.

One day as Hirono is walking to school, a beautiful and voluptuous girlliterally drops out of the sky and into his life.

However, the Cold War tensions between the United States and the Soviet Union have not ended; rather, they've escalated as both sides build military facilities in space, and the shadow of nuclear conflict looms over humanity, both on and off Earth.

Meanwhile, on the Red Planet, an exchange program created by the United Nations to promote peace and understanding is about to begin; the "Cosmic Culture Club", consisting of 16 boys and girls, as well as their instructor Elizabeth, arrives at the UN Mars base, and are being welcomed by the staff. Among the passengers is Anna a 14 year old girl who serves as the narrator for the story.

Suddenly, four unidentified humanoid robots classified as Super Powered Tracers are detected, engaged in fierce combat with each other. The UN base is caught in the crossfire and quickly destroyed, killing all but six members of the "Cosmic Culture Club"--Elizabeth, Arthur, Roan, David, Simone and Anna, and leaving them stranded on an inhospitable planet that has suddenly become a battlefield. As the battle ends, the lone SPT standing lands next to the terrified group and opens up revealing a pilot, who simply announces to them, "Earth is at stake".

The robots who destroyed the UN base were the creation of the Grados, an alien race, from the Udoria system, who came to the Sol system for the purpose of conquest, seeing an easy victory as the two superpowers raged against each other to exaustion--however, this could also be described as an act of pre-emptive self-defense; the Gradosian supercomputers have determined that humanity will eventually cease its infighting and become powerful enough to spread through the galaxy, posing a destructive threat to even the far off Grados.

However, there were two Grados opposed to the plan: human astronaut Ken Asuka, assumed lost during a deep space mission but discovered by the Grados, and his son Null Albarto .

It was here where he was attacked.

Several centuries ago in Nottingham County, a cruel and greedy baron by the name of Alwine ordered the destruction of the Huntingtons' castle&mdash;from the fire of which Robin and his cousins, Will, Winifred and Barbara, miraculously escaped. The youngsters sought shelter in Sherwood Forest, where, thanks to the wise guidance of the hermit better known as &quot;Friar Tuck,&quot; they managed to face the difficulties of a life in the wilderness as as well as they could; however, in the forest there lived a fearless group of young bandits, led by Little John. Their first encounter with Robin and his cousins was at first rather stormy, as the two groups fought for the destiny of a young, noble maiden named Marian who had fallen into the hands of the bandits during an ambush.

Their bitterness, however, rapidly lead the way to friendship, and Robin and John later realized they were all victims of the same fate. The youngsters thus mutually decided to help one another. Baron Alwine was not merely enemy of the Huntingtons&mdash;in fact, a couple years earlier he had forced Little John and his gang to seek protection in the forest to avoid forced labour. He would later seek Marian Lancaster for the secret carved on a cross the girl wore as symbol of her family line.

The girl was to be adopted by the shady Bishop Herfort&mdash;Alwine's accomplice&mdash;who sought to attain the Lancaster's wealth. With all their strength, Robin and his friends were then compelled to fight against the baron's troops, led by Gilbert&mdash;a dangerous and fearless knight. When Winifred and Marian were then imprisoned in the castle's dungeons, our heroes tried in every way possible to enter until their ardour was finally rewarded with success. Thanks to his noble heart and heed for danger, Robin became rapidly known as the protector of the poor and oppressed.

They crash into a black hole which is connected to another universe. The people on the ship are cast adrift in an emergency capsule to a planet called Ismo. The story begins 12 years after they have reached Ismo.

Ismo is a star of the Onam System, which corresponds to the Solar System in our universe. It is the only planet left in the Onam System. The Death Star called Yomi is a comet which regularly approaches the Onam System.

There were once 8 planets in the Onam System. Many years ago, in the time of the gods, there was a war against the evil monster Yamatano Orochi . The gods won the battle. Yamatano Orochi was locked into 8 stones, one of which is buried deep in the center of each planet. Nobody was supposed to have access to the core of the planets. However Tsukuyomi, an evil god who rules Yomi, succeeded in reaching the stones one after another, destroying 7 of the planets using his powerful robots, the Sky Warriors. However, when he tried to acquire the last stone from the planet Ismo, the most powerful Sky Warrior, Susanoo, got out of control and was blown away.

A million years later, the Death Star Yomi is approaching the Onam System once again. Tsukuyomi, the master of Yomi, plans to take this opportunity to realize his dream of ruling the entire universe. He is desperate for the last stone containing Yamatano Orochi. If Tsukuyomi can get hold of this stone, Yamatano Orochi will return to life and its power will become his. Tsukuyomi needs Sky Warrior Susanoo to capture the stone, and sends 8 Sky Soldiers to get Susanoo back. But it is too late. Susanoo no longer belongs to Tsukuyomi. It belongs to Takeru, a 13-year-old boy from Earth, who happened to discover the buried robot Susanoo and woke it from its million-year-long sleep. Takeru becomes involved in the battle against the Sky Soldiers and their evil master, Tsukuyomi.

What he needs is a little inspiration... but he&#039;s been running a little low in that department lately. While Hiro recommends finding a girlfriend, fate has other things in store for him...

Walking through the park late one night, Shuichi&#039;s latest lyrics flutter away and land at the feet of a stunning stranger that takes his breath away. Unfortunately, that mysterious stranger happens to be the famous novelist Eiri Yuki, who completely crushes the young singer by telling him he has &quot;zero talent&quot;. Now, Shuichi&#039;s so annoyed that he&#039;s managed to finish his song just so he can find and confront Yuki once again.

However, in accordance with the theory of relativity, this corresponds to only two subjective years .

The two of them had lost their parents when they were young and the bond between the two is very close. It is Sara&rsquo;s dearest wish to be reunited with her brother. To do that, she must travel to the battlefield where he is.

One day, Sara&rsquo;s planet is suddenly assaulted by Deague forces. To her surprise, her brother, Ralph, turns out to be one of the raiders who successfully kidnap a mysterious girl sleeping in a capsule.

In order to find the truth, Sara gets in a Strain and chases after him. However, she is attacked by Ralph, and the Mimic, a copy of the pilot&rsquo;s brain which is essential to controlling the Strain, is damaged.";i:3;s:2:"TV";i:4;s:2:"13";i:5;s:15:"Finished Airing";i:6;s:11:"Nov 2, 2006";i:7;s:12:"Feb 15, 2007";i:8;s:9:"Fall 2006";i:9;s:15:"Studio Fantasia";i:10;s:8:"Original";i:11;s:39:"Drama,Ecchi,Mecha,Military,Sci-Fi,Space";i:12;s:4:"2702";i:13;s:2:"23";i:14;s:50:"http://myanimelist.net/anime/1602/Soukou_no_Strain";}i:1867;a:15:{i:0;s:5:"17032";i:1;s:13:"Tokyo Tribe 2";i:2;s:351:"This is the other side of Tokyo, a Tokyo of a different color.

During their encounter, there is a sudden, harsh disruption of the Ryumyaku , the flow of arcane energy. The surge awakens within the five teenagers a latent power, giving them each a supernatural ability. Enlightened to their newly acquired gifts by Hisui, the young heir of the Kisaragi Clan who maintains his family&#039;s antiques shop - as well as their duty to protect Tokyo from Oni  - the Magami students decide to use their power to protect the city from the onslaught of dark forces.

Battling the demons alongside Hisui Kisaragi, the five unlikely friends discover that they may have to face a greater threat to Tokyo other than destroying a few malevolent, random monsters. The Ryumyaku had been disrupted by force, from someone invoking the Dark Arts - and that person has a wicked desire to unleash a long-dead evil.

Can the teenagers overcome their own fears and flaws to fight against the Dark Arts? And soon they will also have to face their own destinies as they discover their Stars of Fate.

The story gets its roots from the actual street racing that occurs on Tokyo's Shuto Expressway, one stretch of which is known as the "Wangan", literally meaning "bay side" , the longest, straightest road in the entire country. Of course, there's also lots of traffic to contend with, including a fair number of heavy trucks. Because of this, the action is inherently hazardous, and wrecks are common. Blown engines are also a frequent hazard, especially with the extreme-high power engines. 

One day, Akio Asakura, a third year high school student, is driving his Fairlady Z  and is challenged by Tatsuya Shima, a doctor, in his black Porsche 964 Turbo . With a friend in the passenger seat and two girls in the back, Akio pitifully tries to win, but is defeated. Determined to become faster, he goes to the junkyard to buy parts for his car, when he sees a pristine, unscratched midnight blue Fairlady Z  in the junkyard. Intrigued as to why such a machine is about to be junked, he buys it. He soon finds that the car is unnaturally fast due to a tuned L28 engine, bored and stroked to 3.1 liters combined with twin turbos, which produces 620bhp. He also finds that all of the car's previous owners had unfortunate accidents in it, starting with the first owner's death. The manga follows Akio's various encounters, though the central plot revolves around his constant battle with the BlackBird for superiority";i:3;s:2:"TV";i:4;s:2:"26";i:5;s:15:"Finished Airing";i:6;s:12:"Jun 15, 2007";i:7;s:12:"Sep 13, 2008";i:8;s:11:"Summer 2007";i:9;s:8:"A.C.G.T.";i:10;s:5:"Manga";i:11;s:25:"Action,Cars,Seinen,Sports";i:12;s:4:"1417";i:13;s:2:"29";i:14;s:49:"http://myanimelist.net/anime/2608/Wangan_Midnight";}i:1961;a:15:{i:0;s:4:"2552";i:1;s:15:"Tetsuko no Tabi";i:2;s:2101:"Based on a seinen manga by Kikuchi Naoe and Yokomi Hirohiko, serialised in IKKI. 

The &quot;story&quot; is that a manga artist is asked by her boss to accompany him and a travel-writer on various train trips around Japan and draw a manga about it. 

The kicker though, is that it's completely non-fiction &mdash;the creator really did go on all these trips, and the manga simply records what happened, with no embellishment. There's a little disclaimer at the front that says &quot;This is non-fiction, so I apologize for the lack of drama,&quot; and indeed, it mostly is just about them riding trains from place to place, waiting on platforms, etc. 

The &quot;travel writer&quot; turns out to be a super train-otaku who has vast knowledge of the train network, but also micro-manages all their trips, planning every detail down to the second. He cares mostly about following the schedule and successfully achieving his planned goals . The mangaka doesn't really care about trains; she's cynical, sarcastic, and rather lazy ; he's completely gung-ho as long as he's following the schedule, and the inevitable conflicts are pretty entertaining. 

Throughout, though, it feels real &mdash;if you've travelled by train in Japan it will all seem very familiar, not just the scenery, but also the atmosphere and feel&mdash; and the artist does a great job of pacing and applying little tweaks to keep it consistently entertaining. In an additional bit of recursiveness, some of the characters who show up in the manga  do so because they  read previous episodes of the manga! 

In addition of course, you can learn about various out of the way and interesting Japanese train lines and stations; some of them really do look cool. There's always this vague sense of surreality about it however, the trips are all planned by the train-guy  who seems to consider everything as part of a checklist rather than an experience to be enjoyed. You learn a bit about train-otaku culture too; there's really only the one guy in the story, but train-otaku culture is a sort of constant peripheral presence.

Fifty years have passed since mankind developed the Network society. It was anticipated that this new infrastructure would realize a utopia where people connected with each other at the level of consciousness. However, new social problems such as personal data leaks and proliferation of manipulated information began to surface. Nevertheless, people still relied on the Network to exchange information, and proved unable to opt to abandon it.

In due course, a new Network realm with more effective security measures was developed. This was called Meta Real Network, usually abbreviated as "the Metal."

The Metal accommodated personal memory data within protected virtual stand-alone organic cyber enclaves called bubble shells and eventually pervaded the everyday lives of people.

However, people gradually learned to release and explode their instincts within the secure environment of the Metal. The unleashed instincts pushed each individual's consciousness to drown in the sea of information and to be exposed to the pressures of desire. Meanwhile, norms and regulations continued to bind their real world lives. Thus, strange friction between the two worlds began to manifest themselves as aberrations beyond the bounds of the imaginable.

Experts who challenged the deep sea of the Metal to investigate and decipher such aberrations were called cyber divers.

While the Neuroi primarily attack humanity using aircrafts, their mothership is able to produce a deadly miasma, a chemical that is fatally poisonous to humans, forcing the populations of affected areas to flee their homes. The Neuroi then use the poisoned areas to plunder Earth&#039;s natural resources to use against humanity. Luckily the miasma cannot spread across water, making the ocean humanity&#039;s main line of defense against the Neuroi.

With normal humans unable to fight in the miasma, witches have become the forefront of military defense against the Neuroi. Each witch is able to deploy a defensive field around themselves that not only blocks the miasma but protects them from physical attacks as well. Utilizing leg mounted machines called Striker Units to fly into combat, the witches use their magical abilities to wield devastating weapons too large and ungainly for a normal person.

The Three Kingdoms period has been a popular theme in Japanese manga for decades, but Souten Kouro differs greatly from most of the others on several points. One significant difference is its highly positive portrayal of its main character, Cao Cao, who is traditionally the antagonist in not only Japanese manga, but also most novel versions of the Three Kingdoms period, including the original 14th century version, Romance of the Three Kingdoms by Luo Guanzhong. Another significant difference from others is that the storyline primarily uses the original historical account of the era, Records of Three Kingdoms by Chen Shou, as a reference rather than the aforementioned Romance of the Three Kingdoms novel. By this, the traditional hero of Romance of the Three Kingdoms, Liu Bei, takes on relatively less importance within the story and is portrayed in a less positive light. Yet, several aspects of the story are in fact based on the novel version, including the employment of its original characters such as Diao Chan, as well as anachronistic weapons such as Guan Yu's Green Dragon Crescent Blade and Zhang Fei's Viper Blade.

A consistent theme throughout the story is Cao Cao's perpetual desire to break China and its people away from its old systems and ways of thinking and initiate a focus on pragmatism over empty ideals. This often puts him at odds with the prevalent customs and notions of Confucianism and those that support th";i:3;s:2:"TV";i:4;s:2:"26";i:5;s:15:"Finished Airing";i:6;s:11:"Apr 8, 2009";i:7;s:12:"Sep 30, 2009";i:8;s:11:"Spring 2009";i:9;s:8:"Madhouse";i:10;s:5:"Manga";i:11;s:27:"Action,Adventure,Historical";i:12;s:4:"1768";i:13;s:2:"28";i:14;s:46:"http://myanimelist.net/anime/5226/Souten_Kouro";}i:2250;a:15:{i:0;s:4:"5984";i:1;s:19:"Ristorante Paradiso";i:2;s:635:"When Nicoletta was a little girl, her mother, Olga, abandoned her and ran off to Rome to remarry.

No Longer Human  - A high school student becomes lost and alienated. Despondent and aimless, he falls into a cycle of self abuse, depression and drugs that taints his life for years. Told in four chapters, each chapter deals with a different point in his life and the final chapter leaves him standing alone - an empty and hollow caricature of his former self.

In the Forest, Under Cherries in Full Bloom  - A love story between a 12th-century woman and a mountain bandit who abducts her.

Kokoro - A 1914 tale of a young man's life journey during the Meiji era. The work deals with the transition from the Japanese Meiji society to the modern era, by exploring the friendship between a young man and an older man he calls &quot;Sensei&quot;. It continues the theme of isolation developed in Soseki's previous works, here in the context of interwoven strands of egoism and guilt, as opposed to shame.

Run, Melos!  - An updated retelling of a classic Greek tale of the story of Damon and Pythias. The most prominent theme of &quot;Run, Melos!&quot; is unwavering friendship. Despite facing hardships, the protagonist Melos does his best to save his friend's life, and in the end his efforts are rewarded.

The Spider's Thread  - The Buddha Shakyamuni chances to notice a cold-hearted criminal suffering in Hell. But this criminal did perform one single act of kindness in not stepping on a spider in a forest. Moved by this selfless act, Shakyamuni takes the silvery thread of a spider in Paradise and lowers it down into Hell, but it falls upon the criminal to seize the opportunity and pull himself out - if he can.

Hell Screen  - A famous artist is commissioned by a great lord to create a series of paintings depicting scenes of the &quot;Buddhist Hell.&quot; The artist is unable to paint scenes that he has not seen himself, prompting him to torture and torment the Lord's staff to create his imagined images of hell.

In exchange, the government allowed her to build a special district called The Bund on a man-made island off of the coast of Tokyo, allowing the vampires of the world to finally have a place that they can call home. Knowing not all humans would be keen about the revelation that vampires are real, the Bund is connected to the mainland only by a single underground tunnel. No bridges exist above ground and the Bund has no ports.

Despite these attempts at limited isolationism, tensions begin to run high between human and vampire civilizations. Some humans wish to destroy all vampires as monsters and attack the Bund. At the same time, vampire extremists who want superiority over humans instead of equality with them attempt to sabotage Mina&rsquo;s plans for peace.

YOU! SAY! ME!&quot; The animation takes Japan's 47 prefectures&mdash;or more specifically, the local delicacies or famous landmarks from each of the regions&mdash;and gives them a canine makeover. For example, the &quot;Fukuoka-ken&quot; ,&mdash;Fukuoka of course being home to asianbeat HQ&mdash;uses the delicacy &quot;mentaiko&quot;  as the motif for its canine characterization.

Each of the characters are played by voice actors that hail from each of the individual prefectures, &quot;Fukuoka-ken&quot; being voiced by Fukuoka's Kana Asumi.

Another feature of this anime is the use of regional dialect. All the dogs speak in the dialect of their individual prefectures. So for the Fukuoka dog you hear a lot of &quot;~to&quot; and &quot;~to yo&quot; at the end of sentences; for the Aichi dog it's &quot;~dagane,&quot; and for Ehime, &quot;~zonamoshi,&quot; etc";i:3;s:2:"TV";i:4;s:2:"26";i:5;s:15:"Finished Airing";i:6;s:11:"Apr 7, 2011";i:7;s:12:"Sep 29, 2011";i:8;s:11:"Spring 2011";i:9;s:18:"Pollyanna Graphics";i:10;s:7:"Unknown";i:11;s:11:"Comedy,Kids";i:12;s:4:"7602";i:13;s:2:"99";i:14;s:48:"http://myanimelist.net/anime/27589/47_Todoufuken";}i:2503;a:15:{i:0;s:4:"9493";i:1;s:26:"Dororon Enma-kun Meeramera";i:2;s:209:"It&#039;s Tokyo in the 1970s, and evil youkai  are attacking the human world.

This hardly sits well with Ui&rsquo;s friend Ibuki who swiftly kicks Kazuma and sends him on his way. Much to Kazuma&rsquo;s continued horror, his bad luck is perpetuated at the inn thanks to its landlady Senka and her slightly perverted sense of humor, and then finding out that two of his classmates are the girls he embarrassed himself in front of back in the woods!

Erio is convinced that she is an alien and her mission is to study humanity. She tends to stay wrapped up in a futon, and walks around town barefoot. Needless to say, this strange addition to his family is a stumbling block for Makoto&rsquo;s perfect life.

Rather than his ideal adolescence, Makoto will instead live a more interesting life than he ever could have imagined alongside Erio in Denpa Onna to Seishun O";i:3;s:2:"TV";i:4;s:2:"12";i:5;s:15:"Finished Airing";i:6;s:12:"Apr 15, 2011";i:7;s:11:"Jul 1, 2011";i:8;s:11:"Spring 2011";i:9;s:5:"Shaft";i:10;s:11:"Light novel";i:11;s:34:"Comedy,Sci-Fi,Seinen,Slice of Life";i:12;s:4:"2084";i:13;s:1:"3";i:14;s:61:"http://myanimelist.net/anime/9379/Denpa_Onna_to_Seishun_Otoko";}i:2526;a:15:{i:0;s:5:"10163";i:1;s:44:"C: The Money of Soul and Possibility Control";i:2;s:736:"The Japanese government was rescued from the brink of financial collapse by the Sovereign Wealth Fund.

Half a century later, in New York City, Jonathan&#039;s grandson Joseph Joestar discovers the legacy his grandfather left for him. When an archeological dig unearths the truth behind the stone mask, he realizes that he is the only one who can defeat the Pillar Men, mystical beings of immeasurable power who inadvertently began everything.

Adapted from the first two arcs of Hirohiko Araki&#039;s outlandish manga series, JoJo no Kimyou na Bouken follows the many thrilling expeditions of JoJo and his descendants.
